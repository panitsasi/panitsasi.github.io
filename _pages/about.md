## About Me

I am a PhD candidate in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at Yale University and a member of the [SmartNets Research Group](https://smartnets.yale.edu/) at the Yale Institute for Network Science (YINS). I began my PhD in Fall 2022 under the supervision of [Prof. Leandros Tassiulas](https://engineering.yale.edu/research-and-faculty/faculty-directory/leandros-tassiulas).   My research lies broadly at the intersection of wireless communications, machine learning, and network security.

## Research Interests

**Network Optimization:**
Reinforcement learning techniques for closed-loop control and optimization.

**Network Security:**
Deep learning-based methods for detecting and mitigating security threats in wireless networks.
