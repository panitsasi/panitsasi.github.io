## About Me

I am a PhD student at the Electrical and Computer Engineering Department, Yale University, New Haven, CT. I started my PhD in Fall 2022 under the supervision of **Prof. Leandros Tassiulas**. My research lies broadly at the intersection of wireless communications, machine learning, and network security.

## Research Interests

- **SDN Synchronization:**  
  Reinforcement learning methods for minimizing control plane overhead among distributed SDN controllers.

- **Network Slicing Deployment and Classification:**  
  Deep learning-based techniques for optimal VNF placement, network resource management, and traffic classification in 5G/6G networks.

- **Jamming Detection and Mitigation:**  
  Machine learning-based detection of over-the-air jamming attacks and real-time response strategies for enhancing network security.
