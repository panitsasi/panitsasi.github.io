## About Me

I am a PhD candidate in the Electrical and Computer Engineering Department at Yale University, based in New Haven, CT. I began my PhD in Fall 2022 under the supervision of [Prof. Leandros Tassiulas](https://engineering.yale.edu/research-and-faculty/faculty-directory/leandros-tassiulas). I am a member of the [SmartNets Research Group](https://smartnets.yale.edu/) at the Yale Institute for Network Science (YINS). 

My research lies broadly at the intersection of wireless communications, machine learning, and network security, with a focus on next-generation network architectures.

## Research Interests

- **SDN Synchronization:**  
  Reinforcement learning methods for minimizing control plane overhead among distributed SDN controllers.

- **Network Slicing Deployment and Classification:**  
  Deep learning-based techniques for optimal VNF placement, network resource management, and traffic classification in 5G/6G networks.

- **Jamming Detection and Mitigation:**  
  Machine learning-based detection of over-the-air jamming attacks and real-time response strategies for enhancing network security.
