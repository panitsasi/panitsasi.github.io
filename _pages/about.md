I am a PhD candidate in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at Yale University and a member of the [SmartNets research group](https://smartnets.yale.edu/) at the Yale Institute for Network Science (YINS). I began my PhD in Fall 2022 under the supervision of [Prof. Leandros Tassiulas](https://engineering.yale.edu/research-and-faculty/faculty-directory/leandros-tassiulas). My research lies at the intersection of cellular networks and machine learning.
